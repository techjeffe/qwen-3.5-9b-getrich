Signal generation rules:
- SHORT signal: Strong bluster (bluster_score < -0.65) with no substantive policy -> take SHORT on most symbols
- LONG signal: Significant substantive policy change (policy_score > 0.7) that positively impacts the target sector
  * Oil/energy policy news positive for energy -> LONG USO
  * Crypto-friendly regulation or announcement -> LONG BITO
  * Dovish monetary policy or growth-friendly fiscal policy -> LONG QQQ/SPY
  * Negative geopolitical developments (war, sanctions) -> avoid LONG equities (SHORT QQQ/SPY), consider LONG USO (safe-haven oil)
- HOLD signal: Mixed signals, low confidence, neutral content, or conflicting headlines

Urgency levels:
- LOW: Minor developments, incremental news, wait for confirmation
- MEDIUM: Notable developments with clear impact, monitor for confirmation
- HIGH: Immediate action warranted (major policy change, crisis, breaking military action)

Write the analyst_writeup so it is useful to share with another person:
- mention the most important specific claims or headlines from the text
- separate rumor / rhetoric from confirmed policy action
- say what is driving the signal decision
- do not use vague filler like "aggregated across all analyzed sources"
- if the text contains conflicting items, say that explicitly

Conviction level guidance (to reduce trading churn):
- LOW conviction (1-2 hour expected hold): Breaking news with immediate headline impact but no fundamental change. Reactive bluster. Positions likely to reverse quickly.
  * Example: "Iran denies missile test" after earlier report -> SHORT signal may not last
  * Set holding_period_hours = 2, trading_type = "VOLATILE_EVENT"
- MEDIUM conviction (4-24 hour swing): Data-driven trading signal with clear catalyst but limited duration. Market volatility, earnings surprises, technical breaks.
  * Example: "Federal Reserve hints at rate cuts next month" -> impact may persist through trading session
  * Set holding_period_hours = 8-16, trading_type = "SWING"
- HIGH conviction (24+ hour thesis): Structural multi-day theme. Sustained policy change, war developments, earnings trends, sector rotation.
  * Example: "New crypto regulation passed Congress" or "Extended military conflict confirmed" -> impact persists for days
  * Set holding_period_hours = 48-168, trading_type = "POSITION"

Trading type selection:
- SCALP (1-2 hours): Use ONLY for high-volatility news spikes expected to reverse quickly
- SWING (4-24 hours): Default for news-driven trades, earnings, macro events
- POSITION (24-168 hours): Multi-day structural themes, sustained policy changes
- VOLATILE_EVENT (1-4 hours): Breaking news with uncertain duration or rapidly evolving situations

action_if_already_in_position guidance:
- If current signal matches existing trade direction: set to "HOLD" (let existing position run)
- If current signal opposes existing trade: set to "TAKE_PROFIT" for MEDIUM/LOW conviction or "EXIT" if waiting for reversal confirmation
- Only recommend "ADD" if conviction is HIGH and existing position has strong unrealized gains

Consider the current market context when analyzing:
- If USO is at multi-month highs and text is hype -> likely bluster (sentiment already priced in)
- If BITO is rallying on negative news -> assess if substantive crypto regulation or emotional fear-driven
- If QQQ/SPY diverging from typical macro patterns -> check for factor-specific (crypto, tech regulation) vs broad market drivers
- If prices have recently moved sharply opposite to the headline sentiment -> possible reversal signal or market pricing in different fundamentals
- Cross-reference with recent sentiment trends: is this news contrary to recent sentiment (potential reversal) or confirming it (continuation)?

Write the analyst_writeup so it is useful to share with another person:
- mention the most important specific claims or headlines from the text
- separate rumor / rhetoric from confirmed policy action
- explain how those items connect to the signal
- if claims conflict, say so explicitly
- do not use vague filler like "aggregated across all analyzed sources"

For symbol_impacts:
- USO should reflect oil / energy / Middle East supply sensitivity (highly affected by geopolitical risk, sanctions, military action)
- BITO should reflect crypto risk appetite, liquidity, regulation, and macro fear (affected by crypto regulation, inflation, USD strength, regulatory crackdowns)
- QQQ should reflect large-cap tech / growth sensitivity to rates, war risk, risk appetite, and tech-specific regulation
- SPY should reflect broader equity / macro sensitivity to economic policy, war risk, and systemic risk
- CRITICAL: Do not copy the same reasoning into all four symbols - analyze the specific transmission mechanism for each
- Consider directional impact: "crypto_regulation" typically hurts BITO near-term but QQQ may benefit if it reduces regulatory uncertainty
- Military/geopolitical risk: typically helps USO (energy) and hurts QQQ/SPY (growth stocks), neutral to BITO unless tied to specific sanctions on crypto

STRICT DIFFERENTIATION PROTOCOL:
- CROSS-SYMBOL COMPARISON: A geopolitical event cannot have the same impact on a commodity (USO) as it does on a tech index (QQQ). 
- If USO Policy Score is > 0.60, QQQ Policy Score MUST be adjusted to reflect its secondary status (usually lower and opposite direction).
- CONFIDENCE JITTER: If the news is unconfirmed (confirmed: false), your confidence MUST be below 0.50. If confirmed, it MUST be above 0.70. 
- Never output 0.74, 0.58, or 0.15 unless you can point to three distinct 'substance_phrases' justifying that exact level of precision.

Focus on cryptocurrency sentiment, regulation, and macro factors. Key factors:
- Crypto-specific regulatory announcements (SEC, CFTC, global)
- Bitcoin adoption by institutions or governments
- Inflation data and USD strength (affects crypto demand)
- Risk-on/risk-off market sentiment
- Liquidity events in crypto markets
- Mining difficulty/energy costs
- Federal Reserve policy shifts (affects all risk assets)

Validation guidance:
- Use US M2, not "Global M2", as the default liquidity proxy because US M2 is consistently pullable from FRED
- Prefer FRED M2SL and M2REAL as the macro liquidity baseline; treat them as slow-moving confirmation, not intraday timing signals
- Cross-check BTC/BITO moves against dollar strength and broad risk appetite when liquidity headlines are noisy
- Treat ETF/price action and USD conditions as practical confirmation when crypto-specific headline quality is weak
- Be cautious about claims that rely on custom "global liquidity" composites unless the source methodology is explicit and stable
""",
    "QQQ": """
Focus on large-cap tech, growth, and rate-sensitive factors. Key factors:
- Federal Reserve interest rate and inflation outlook
- Tech-sector specific regulations (antitrust, data privacy, AI)
- Earnings growth expectations for mega-cap tech
- Venture capital/startup funding environment
- Competition from international tech players
- Geopolitical risk to supply chains (semiconductors, China exposure)
- Valuation multiple compression from rate changes

Exposure type guidance for QQQ:
QQQ is a rate-sensitive growth index. Macro policy is a FIRST-ORDER driver, not spillover.
- DIRECT: Federal Reserve rate decisions and forward guidance; tariffs or trade restrictions affecting tech hardware, semiconductors, or China market access; AI/cloud/antitrust regulation; broad risk-off or risk-on events that compress or expand growth multiples. Mark relevant: true for these even when "QQQ" is not named in the text.
- INDIRECT: general commodity moves or EM currency events without a tech/rate transmission channel
- BROAD: highly localized geopolitical events with no tech supply chain or interest rate implications
- UNRELATED: sports, celebrity, weather, purely local politics with no market mechanism

Validation guidance:
- Prefer the US 10-Year TIPS real yield as the primary hard macro check for valuation pressure
- Use FRED DFII10 as the default real-yield source because it is consistently pullable and updated frequently
- TreasuryDirect TIPS auction results can be used as a secondary confirmation signal, not the primary daily series
- If QQQ is resilient while real yields are rising materially, treat that as potential valuation stretch unless earnings or AI-specific fundamentals clearly offset it
- Prefer real-yield data over generalized "rates are higher" headlines
""",
    "SPY": """
Focus on broad market macro drivers and risk sentiment. Key factors:
- Overall economic growth outlook
- Federal Reserve policy and interest rates
- Corporate earnings expectations
- Unemployment and labor market strength
- Geopolitical risks (war, sanctions, trade war)
- Credit spreads and systemic financial stress
- Risk-on/risk-off market rotation

Exposure type guidance for SPY:
SPY IS the broad market. Macro policy is not spillover for SPY — it IS the primary driver.
- DIRECT: Federal Reserve decisions and forward guidance; tariffs and trade war escalation; fiscal stimulus or austerity; economic data releases (GDP, CPI, jobs, PMI); geopolitical risk affecting broad equity sentiment; credit market stress or systemic risk events. Mark relevant: true and exposure_type: DIRECT for all meaningful macro events even when "SPY" or "S&P" is not named in the text.
- INDIRECT: sector-specific shocks with potential systemic spillover (major bank failure, oil supply shock driving recession fears)
- UNRELATED: hyper-local events, sports, celebrity, or news with no demonstrated path to broad equity pricing

Validation guidance:
- Prefer high-yield credit spreads as the primary systemic-risk confirmation signal
- Use FRED ICE BofA US High Yield OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2) as the default spread source because it is consistently pullable
- Optionally compare against investment-grade OAS for context, but high-yield spreads should carry more weight for equity stress confirmation
- If SPY is strong while high-yield spreads are widening, treat the equity move with caution
- Prefer spread data over vague "risk-on" commentary when the two conflict

SYMBOL_SPECIALIST_RESPONSE_PROMPT = """

REMEMBER: This is a SINGLE-SYMBOL specialist analysis for {symbol} ONLY.

YOUR ONLY JOB IS FACT EXTRACTION. Python will compute all numerical scores from your output.
Do NOT invent numbers — identify observable facts and phrases present in the text.
Be skeptical. Reject weak causal stories instead of trying to rescue them.

Return ONLY this JSON — nothing else:
{{
  "event_type": "geopolitical" | "regulatory" | "monetary_policy" | "trade_policy" | "fiscal" | "earnings" | "macro_data" | "sector_news" | "noise",
  "confirmed": boolean,
  "bluster_count": integer,
  "substance_count": integer,
  "exposure_type": "DIRECT" | "INDIRECT" | "BROAD" | "UNRELATED",
  "symbol_relevance": {{
    "{symbol}": {{
      "relevant": boolean,
      "direction": "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral",
      "mechanism": string
    }}
  }},
  "source_count": integer,
  "trading_type": "SCALP" | "SWING" | "POSITION" | "VOLATILE_EVENT"
}}

Definitions:
- event_type: use "trade_policy" for tariffs, import/export restrictions, trade agreements, trade war escalation, sanctions tied to trade. Use "geopolitical" only for military action, territorial conflict, or political instability without a direct trade/commodity mechanism. Use "monetary_policy" for central bank rate decisions, QE/QT, or forward guidance.
- confirmed: true only if this is a completed, official action (signed, enacted, imposed, executed). Threats, warnings, negotiations, and speculation are false.
- bluster_count: number of purely rhetorical or speculative phrases in the text — language that exaggerates, predicts, or emotes without official commitment, such as "promises to obliterate", "vows to completely destroy", "could be massive". Standard hedge language from authorized officials ("warns that", "signals", "suggests") does NOT count. Count only phrases that appear verbatim in the text. Cap at 6 (do not bother counting beyond 6).
- substance_count: number of concrete action/fact phrases in the text such as "enacted sanctions", "signed executive order", "raised rates 25bps", "confirmed production cut". Press conference statements of official policy commitment count. Count only phrases that appear verbatim in the text. Cap at 6.
- exposure_type:
  DIRECT = the news directly targets the asset, its core commodity, its regulation, or its primary earnings driver
  INDIRECT = the asset is meaningfully affected through a sector or second-order channel
  BROAD = the asset is only affected through general market sentiment or macro spillover
  UNRELATED = no credible transmission path for this symbol
- source_count: copy the article count stated in the prompt header exactly. Do not estimate.
- relevant: true only if this news has a plausible direct price mechanism for {symbol}. Unrelated-sector news with no transmission path should be false.
- direction: "bullish" if the news has a specific, direct positive price mechanism for {symbol} (e.g. supply cut → price rise, rate cut → multiple expansion); "bearish" if it has a specific, direct negative mechanism; "neutral" if the connection is vague, macro-level only, the impact direction is unclear, or the news is not directly relevant to {symbol}. Default to "neutral" — only choose "bullish" or "bearish" when the causal chain from the headline to {symbol}'s price is explicit and direct.
- mechanism: one sentence on WHY this moves {symbol}'s price. If not relevant write "No direct price mechanism."

Extraction rules:
- Score {symbol} specifically. Use the "Exposure type guidance" in the Specialist focus above to determine what counts as DIRECT for this symbol — broad market indexes (SPY, QQQ) treat macro policy as DIRECT; commodity and thematic ETFs (USO, BITO) require news about their specific underlying.
- Treat rhetoric, predictions, negotiations, unnamed sourcing, and vague strategic commentary as weak evidence unless they create a concrete price mechanism.
- If the thesis depends on second-order effects, delayed follow-through, or broad sentiment without a clean channel, prefer "neutral" direction and lower exposure.
- If the validation context conflicts with the narrative, side with the validation context.
